Feature: Validation
  As application user
  I want to application validates my input
  So I won't save bad data into persistent storage

  Scenario: If user name 4 or less characters long then validation error should occur and username should not be changed
    Given started instance
    When user set username between 0 and 4 chars length
    Then validation errors count should be 1
    And username should not be changed

  Scenario: If user name 65 or more characters long then validation error should occur and username should not be changed
    Given started instance
    When user set username between 65 and 1024 chars length
    Then validation errors count should be 1
    And username should not be changed

  Scenario: If user name between 5 and 64 character length then no validation errors should occur and username should be changed
    Given started instance
    When user set username between 5 and 64 chars length
    Then validation errors count should be 0
    And username should be changed
